Assuming that you have a function that calculte a metric to fulfill a specific business need, but your team need it as well, are we going to tell your team to copy the code in some files in some repositories? Sounds that still works, now imagine we have 100 of functions like that...

## Introduction

Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a cloud computing model that allows users to create, deploy, and run application functions without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It is a form of serverless computing, meaning users don’t have to worry about provisioning, scaling, or managing servers.

## What are the Benefits of FaaS?

FaaS offers a number of advantages over traditional server-based computing models. It is more cost-effective, since users only pay for the time the application is running, rather than having to pay for a fixed-cost hosting service. Additionally, FaaS requires less maintenance, since the cloud provider is responsible for managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. Finally, FaaS is highly scalable, allowing users to easily increase or decrease the amount of computing power or storage they use depending on their needs.

## What Types of Applications Can FaaS Offer?

FaaS can be used to develop a wide variety of applications, from simple web applications to complex enterprise applications. It is also ideal for hosting microservices, since functions can be quickly deployed and scaled without requiring additional infrastructure. Additionally, FaaS can be used for event-driven applications, since functions can be triggered when certain events occur.

## Tools to getting started

### Using Cloud Services

Getting started with FaaS is easy, as there are a variety of tools available to help users develop, deploy, and manage their applications. Popular tools include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. These tools provide users with the ability to easily create, deploy, and manage their functions, as well as access to a variety of services and features.

### Self-deployment with OSS

OpenWhisk and OpenFaaS are two open source FaaS platforms that are gaining popularity. OpenWhisk is an Apache-licensed serverless platform built on IBM’s Bluemix cloud platform. It enables developers to build, deploy and manage event-driven applications and functions. OpenFaaS is an open source serverless platform built on Docker and Kubernetes. It enables developers to quickly deploy and manage functions, as well as access to a range of services and features. Both OpenWhisk and OpenFaaS are widely used for rapidly building, deploying, and managing functions, making them ideal for a wide range of applications.

## Conclusion

FaaS is a powerful cloud computing model that offers a number of advantages over traditional server-based computing models. It is cost-effective, requires less maintenance, and is highly scalable, making it ideal for a wide variety of applications.
