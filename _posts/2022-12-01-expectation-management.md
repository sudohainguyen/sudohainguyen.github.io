## Intro

Expectation management is a crucial part of the product management process. It involves ensuring that stakeholders have realistic expectations of a product's development, launch, and long-term performance. This blog post will discuss the importance of expectation management, best practices for setting expectations, and techniques for managing stakeholders' expectations.

## Why is Expectation Management Important?

Failing to manage expectations can have serious repercussions. Stakeholders may become frustrated if their expectations are not met, leading to delays in product development, internal conflict, and a decrease in customer satisfaction. On the other hand, properly managing expectations can foster a better understanding between product teams and stakeholders and help ensure that the product meets customer needs.

## Core techniques

### Analysis - What kind of questions to answer?

#### What do you expect?

#### What do stakeholders expect?

### Extablish a common 'North Star'

#### Are we all in the same page?

### Finale - Keep in the loop



## Conclusion

Expectation management is essential for successful product management. Product teams should be honest and transparent with stakeholders, provide regular progress updates, and create a timeline to keep everyone on the same page. By following these best practices, teams can ensure that expectations are managed properly and that the product meets customer needs.
