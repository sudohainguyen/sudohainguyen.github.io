To rapidly progress in your engineering career, it is advisable to learn from other engineers in your professional circle, such as colleagues, seniors, and friends especially when you are working on some immature area like MLOps. However, many individuals, myself included, often wonder how engineers from diverse companies, organizations, and countries approach their work without frequently changing your jobs. Engaging with open source projects is an effective solution to this challenge. By contributing to such projects, you can gain valuable exposure to a variety of engineering perspectives and practices, which can broaden your understanding and improve your skills.

## What does the term Open Source projects mean?

Open source refers to software that is made freely available to the public, along with the underlying source code that is used to build the software. This means that anyone can access, modify, and distribute the software, provided they adhere to the conditions set out in the software's license agreement. The open source philosophy emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development, with the goal of creating high-quality, accessible software that can be used and improved by anyone. Many popular MLOps tools and platforms, including [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), feature store [Feast](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast), and [MLFlow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow), are built on open source principles.

## Pros and Cons

Working in open source projects can be both rewarding and challenging. On the one hand, contributing to open source projects provides an opportunity to gain real-world experience, exposure to industry-standard tools and technologies, and networking opportunities. On the other hand, it can be difficult to balance open source contributions with other commitments, the learning curve can be steep, and there may be conflicts and competing priorities to navigate.

### The opportunities

One of the biggest benefits of working in open source projects is the opportunity to gain real-world experience. By contributing to open source projects, you can work on real-world problems and gain practical experience that you might not be able to get through academic or personal projects alone. Additionally, open source projects often use popular industry-standard tools and technologies, which can help you approach new knowledge with tools and technologies that are in demand in the job market.

### The challenges

However, working in open source projects can also be challenging. One of the biggest challenges is finding the time to contribute to the project while balancing other commitments, such as paid work or personal projects. Additionally, the learning curve for contributing to open source projects can be steep, particularly if you are new to the project or the technologies it uses. Finally, open source projects often have multiple contributors, each with their own priorities and agendas, which can lead to conflicts and competing priorities.

## How to get started?

Don't pressure yourself into taking on overly ambitious tasks to build a new feature or fix a critical bugs on the issue list, that would make you going nowhere in terms of either your learning or impact on the project. Instead, pick a project that is related to your daily basis tasks or maybe you are the actual user of the tools, this will help you have a good starting and an chance to deep dive into underlying mechanism of the tool.
One of my very first open source projects is Feast and at that time I was using it to build a feature engineering platform for my primary job. As an user, I discovered there are some functionalities should be added and this is when I join the project. As a result, I made a significant contribution by escalate Feast BigQuery offline store scalability by 10 times.

# Conclusion

Contributing Open Source projects is not the silver bullet to build up yourself, this is just one of many ways to grow your skills. But I believe it is still worth it to spend some efforts, isn't it
