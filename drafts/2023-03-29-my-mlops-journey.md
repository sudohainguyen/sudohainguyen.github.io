In today's data-driven world, the demand for machine learning models has skyrocketed, leading organizations to invest heavily in their AI capabilities. However, building and deploying machine learning models efficiently is not a straightforward task. This is where MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) engineers come into play. In this blog post, I will uncover my journey as an MLOps engineer so far and share some of the lessons I have learned along the way.


## The Role of an MLOps Engineer

Let's revisit the definition of MLOps engineer. According to [Google](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), MLOps engineers are responsible for the efficient development, deployment, and management of machine learning models. They play a vital role in ensuring the smooth integration of machine learning into the overall business operations. MLOps engineers combine their knowledge of data science, software engineering, and operations to create robust and scalable machine learning systems.

Ideally, to smoothly deliver a sustainable ML project, an MLOps engineer play a role who connects the dots across cell teams, such as orchestrating, deploying and monitoring data and ML models. However, due to maturity of each organization, some teams may not have the luxury of having a dedicated MLOps team, they prefer to have a Data Scientist or Data Engineer to take care of the whole ML project, including integrating MLOps tools to boost their productivity. In this case, we need a centralized platform that can serve stakeholders for specific purposes (build, serve, monitor,...), which is built by a standalone MLOps team, this is also my MLOps story.

## Day-to-Day Tasks as an MLOps Engineer:

### Building Internal Platforms:
One of the primary responsibilities is to design and build internal platforms to support the development and deployment of machine learning models. These platforms include:

- Feature Platform: An MLOps engineer develops a feature platform that allows data scientists to efficiently extract, transform, and manage features used in machine learning models. This platform enables feature engineering at scale and ensures data consistency across different models.

- MLOps Platform: MLOps engineers create an MLOps platform that facilitates the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning models in production. This platform automates tasks such as model versioning, model serving, and monitoring model performance, enabling seamless collaboration between data scientists and operations teams.

### Collaboration with Data Scientists:
MLOps engineers work closely with data scientists to understand their requirements and translate them into scalable and reproducible machine learning pipelines. They help data scientists optimize their code, implement best practices, and ensure the models are production-ready. Collaboration between MLOps engineers and data scientists is essential for creating efficient machine learning workflows.

### Infrastructure Management:
Managing the underlying infrastructure for machine learning projects is another crucial responsibility of an MLOps engineer. They configure and maintain scalable computing resources, containerization technologies, and orchestration systems. MLOps engineers optimize infrastructure to ensure efficient model training and deployment, considering factors like cost, performance, and scalability.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment:
Beside of primary products, I also work on establishing robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines for internal platforms as well as machine learning projects. The pipelines automate the testing, integration, and deployment of internal SDK and models, ensuring rapid iteration and reducing time to productionization.

## The challenges

Having your own product seems to be a dream for every engineer, but it's not always going in a happy way. I have to face a lot of challenges along the way, from technical to non-technical aspects.

Whoever you are working as, a dedicated engineer or a platform engineer, to excel in the role of an MLOps engineer, individuals should possess a diverse skill set to fulfill the above tasks cycle, including:

- Strong Software Engineering: Proficiency in programming languages like Python, knowledge of software
development methodologies, and experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) are essential.

- Data Engineering: Understanding data pipelines, data storage, and data processing frameworks is crucial for building scalable and efficient machine learning systems.

- DevOps: Familiarity with DevOps practices, including infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), is necessary for managing the machine learning infrastructure.

- Machine Learning: A solid understanding of machine learning concepts, model development, and evaluation techniques is essential to collaborate effectively with data scientists.

- Cloud Technologies: Experience with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud is advantageous. Knowledge of deploying and managing machine learning models in cloud environments is valuable.
